# What is a Preview system?
The Preview system allows you to see changes of the Domik scriptable objects right in the scene. 

The Domik contains a premade Preview system instance prefab, so feel free to use it with example house. To use it just drag'n'drop the PREVIEW prefab from the Domik folder to the scene.
